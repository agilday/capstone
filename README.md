# PetPro Scheduler

## Introduction
PetPro Scheduler is a custom application created for my client, the user, whose busy pet grooming business has outgrown the need for a simple appointment book.
  I wanted to create something applicable to real-world scenarios, so when this opportunity arose, I welcomed it. Not only is it great experience for me as an engineer to create something challenging, but to also get feedback directly from the user helps me to understand what our priorities are, what my workflow should look like, and how I can best collaborate with my client to meet their needs.
  Over the course of this project (so far!), I have learned so very much about carefully creating an application back-to-front, deploying it, testing it, breaking it, and debugging it.

## Future Plans
 What makes this project so exciting for me is our ambitious plans for the future of this application. There are a number of features to be added:
* Pet Groomer Profiles- Because the usert anticipates hiring additional groomers in order to accommodate the workload, it will be important to maintain individual groomer profiles. These will contain daily, weekly, and monthly schedule displays, information on what species of animals that groomer does/does not provide services for, and basic personal details.
* Individual pet profiles- We know how meaningful it is to pet owners when their pets are genuinely cared for, so this one is a high priority. Pet profiles will keep information about the pet such as species, age, name, vaccination expiry dates, status (deceased or living), whether or not the animal is aggressive, and any other special care that should be taken for that specific pet.
* Red flags at scheduling- When an attempt is made to schedule an appointmment for an animal whose vaccines have expired or who have a history of aggression, this will trigger a prompt during scheduling to allow the scheduler to take necessary precautions.
* Improved Client profiles- The user wants to maintain his large client base, and do so with care. Client profiles will track lifetime sales totals, a history of appointments, and links to pet profiles associated with that client (in addition to the details already stored in client profiles).
* Automated scheduling prompts- These will prompt the user to schedule the next appointment for a client during the checkout process.
* Automated call lists- Call lists will be generated to show clients whose most recent appointment was >5 weeks prior and did not schedule their next appointment during checkout.
* Basic finance tracking- Sales totals (by day, week, month, and year) and expenses will be available for the user to view.

These future plans reflect our vision for reduced stress, more organized workflow, and greater productivity for the user. I appreciate having this opportunity to champion a small business and contribute to its success.
